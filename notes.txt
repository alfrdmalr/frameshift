"CELL" class that serves as the 'home' class
	can store the nucleotide sequence, amino acid sequence, etc
map all amino acids to their symbols (if they have symbols) -- needs to be type char

ribosome:
scan until reading frame is found, save index

## new plan!
Scan function; give it the start codon and STOP codons
and get those indices
can then just translate from
startIndex + 3 (inclusive) -> stopIndex (not inclusive)

actually everything is relative to START

COULD implement ICodonSet where there's an abstract AminoAcid class. Allows for custom amino acids and sets of codons corresponding to them. Would need to refactor some methods around amino acids.
